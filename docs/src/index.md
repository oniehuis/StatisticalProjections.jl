# StatisticalProjections.jl

StatisticalProjections provides chemometric projection methods in Julia, currently centered
on CPPLS-DA for supervised classification tasks. The goal is to enable reproducible
preprocessing, fitting, and validation pipelines, so common chemometric analyses stay
transparent and auditable.

## Installation

The package is not registered, so install it directly from GitHub:

```
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/oniehuis/StatisticalProjections.jl
```

After the installation finishes you can load it in the Julia REPL with:

```
julia> using StatisticalProjections
```

## Current capabilities

- A pure-Julia implementation of Canonical Powered Partial Least Squares Discriminant
  Analysis (CPPLS-DA; Indahl et al. 2019, Liland & Indahl 2009) that handles collinear 
  predictors and exports interpretable loadings and scores.
- Cross-validation utilities (`nested_cv`, `nested_cv_permutation`) for selecting the
  number of latent components and estimating classification performance or permutation
  baselines (Smit et al. 2007; currently only validated for discriminant/classification
  models).
- Permutation-based significance testing via `calculate_p_value` to quantify whether
  observed accuracies exceed what would be expected by chance.
- Optional preprocessing utilities so that scaling, centering, or other chemometric
  transformations can be folded into the modeling workflow.

## Quick taste

```@example 1
using StatisticalProjections
using Random
using Statistics

rng = MersenneTwister(1)
X = randn(rng, 60, 30)                                     # predictors (e.g., spectra)
labels = repeat(["classA", "classB"], inner=30)
Y, _ = labels_to_one_hot(labels)

accuracies, components = nested_cv(
    X, Y;
    max_components=2,
    num_outer_folds=3,
    num_inner_folds=2,
    rng=rng,
    verbose=false)

best_components = floor(Int, median(components))           # consensus components across folds
model = fit_cppls_light(X, Y, best_components; gamma=0.5)
ŷ = predictonehot(model, predict(model, X))                # fitted class indicators

permutation_scores = nested_cv_permutation(
    X, Y;
    max_components=2,
    num_outer_folds=3,
    num_inner_folds=2,
    num_permutations=25,
    rng=rng,
    verbose=false)

p_value = calculate_p_value(permutation_scores, mean(accuracies))
```

The calculated `p_value` reports the empirical probability of obtaining mean accuracies
this high when class labels are randomly permuted, so smaller values suggest structure
unlikely to arise from chance alone.

## Usage

- Learn how to fit models (options, preprocessing, γ-search) in
  [`CPPLS/fit.md`](CPPLS/fit.md) and how to generate projections or class predictions in
  [`CPPLS/predict.md`](CPPLS/predict.md).
- Dive into the cross-validation and permutation tooling described in
  [`CPPLS/crossvalidation.md`](CPPLS/crossvalidation.md).
- Inspect the underlying data structures (`CPPLS`, `CPPLSLight`, preprocessing helpers)
  once you need finer control in [`CPPLS/types.md`](CPPLS/types.md) and
  [`CPPLS/internal.md`](CPPLS/internal.md).

## Disclaimer

StatisticalProjections is research software provided “as is.” You remain responsible for
validating every discriminant analysis and any downstream decision or deployment based on
these models; the authors cannot be held liable if the algorithms produce misleading or
incorrect results.
