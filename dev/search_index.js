The first dimension indexes samples, the second is the axis along which correlations are reported, the third are the channels averaged with Fisher’s z.  \nscores::AbstractVector{<:Real}   Vector of length n_samples. Represents a single 1-D target signal (e.g. class separation scores) to correlate against.  \nweights::Symbol = :mean   How to weight correlations across the third dimension:  \n:mean — weight by the mean intensity of each channel (default).  \n:none — equal weights for all channels.  \n\nReturns\n\nρ::Vector{Float64} of length n_axis₁.   Each entry is the Fisher-z–averaged correlation between scores and all channels at that position of axis₁.\n\nNotes\n\nCorrelations are clamped to the open interval (-1, 1) before Fisher’s transform to avoid infinities.  \nFisher’s z stabilizes correlations before averaging; the result is then back-transformed to a standard correlation coefficient.  \n\nExample\n\n```julia X = randn(20, 50, 10)        # 20 samples × 50 axis₁ × 10 axis₂ scores = randn(20)           # separation scores per sample ρ = fisherztrack(X, scores)  # length 50 correlation track\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"internals/base/#StatisticalProjections.robustcor","page":"Base","title":"StatisticalProjections.robustcor","text":"robustcor(x, y)\n\nCompute the Pearson correlation between two vectors, returning 0.0 in degenerate cases.\n\nArguments\n\nx::AbstractVector\ny::AbstractVector\n\nReturns\n\nc::Float64 — the correlation coefficient in [-1, 1].\n\nBehavior\n\nIf either vector has zero standard deviation, returns 0.0.  \nIf cor(x, y) is NaN or Inf, returns 0.0.  \nOtherwise returns the finite correlation value.  \n\nExample\n\nrobustcor([1,2,3], [2,4,6])    # 1.0\nrobustcor([1,1,1], [2,3,4])    # 0.0 (zero variance in x)\nrobustcor([1,2,3], [NaN,2,3])  # 0.0 (invalid correlation)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"internals/base/#StatisticalProjections.separationaxis","page":"Base","title":"StatisticalProjections.separationaxis","text":"separationaxis(Xscores, Y; method=:centroid, positive_class=1)\n\nCompute a one-dimensional separation axis in score space for a binary problem.  \n\nArguments\n\nXscores::AbstractMatrix{<:Real}   An n × p score matrix (rows = samples, columns = score axes).  \np = 1: Fast path — the axis is the single score dimension.  \np ≥ 2: Axis is computed by centroid or LDA method.  \nY::AbstractMatrix{<:Real}   An n × 2 strict one-hot class indicator matrix.
